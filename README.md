# Breath of the Wild Freecam
![Rust](https://github.com/etra0/botw-freecam/workflows/Rust/badge.svg)

**This fork is intended for simultaneous use of a SDL Controller for game input and an Xinput Controller for camera input**
This fork removes the XInput blocker, allowing for Xinput controllers to be used for the freecam on Cemu version 2.0, but also assumes you have a seperate SDL input controller, such as a Nintendo Switch Pro controller (without Betterjoy) or Dualsense, to control the game.

This is a BOTW Freecam. Simply run it after the game has opened and it should work.

Tested with Cemu 2.0-31 and Breath of the Wild v1.5.0 DLC Ver.3.0 (**Support for other versions is not assured**)

**WARNING: If you close the console it'll close the game. Press HOME to close it.**

**This tool can be flagged as a virus, check https://github.com/etra0/botw-freecam/issues/17**

**If you run Cemu as admin, you **must** run the tool as admin as well.**

**If your CPU is pre 2016, this tool may not work for you right now**
